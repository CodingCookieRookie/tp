ATAS is a **desktop app for managing students’ particulars, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type really quickly, ATAS will help you to manage your contacts and students’ particulars faster than traditional GUI apps.

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* The words in `UPPER_CASE` are placeholders to be replaced by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/STUDENT_NAME` should be changed to `add n/John Cena`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Cena t/1F` or simply as `n/John Cena`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/1F`, `t/1F t/2G` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME m/MATRICULATION_NUMBER`, `m/MATRICULATION_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
